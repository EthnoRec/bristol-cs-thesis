\section{Data collection}
The quantity and the quality of training data is crucial to all computer vision projects. 
However, for this task there was no luxury of using an existing dataset with 
the required level of detail in labels that would also be affordable.

A decision was made to collect own data for this project from a social network that 
makes it easy to associate user profiles with photos of themselves with locations accurate to city-level.
Popular social networks such as Facebook would be ideal for this, however it is not possible to obtain 
a list of profiles from a hand-picked location due to Facebook API constraints. Moreover, it is clearly 
stated in Facebook's Terms and Conditions that any way to circumvent these constraints would still count as a violation.


\subsection{Tinder}
Tinder is a mobile dating application that shows profiles closest to the user's GPS location. 
There have been numerous third-party Tinder utilities on the Web that reverse-engineered Tinder's simple 
and unobfuscated HTTP API that makes it possible to create a fully-featured Tinder client yourself.

The API has support for various actions such as liking and messaging users, but for the purposes of this project, 
the only relevant actions to us are authentication, setting own location using 
latitude and longitude coordinates and fetching nearby users.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
Tinder profiles are created using Facebook OAuth. When the application is opened for the first time by a non-registered user,
they will be prompted to login using Facebook OAuth which gives Tinder access to the user's full name, age, pictures and other details.

A user profile was created specifically for this project using the original Tinder mobile application on an Android phone. 
This made it possible to authenticate with Tinder using Facebook OAuth which takes Tinder's 
application ID and upon successful Facebook authentication returns an authentication token that is sent with every Tinder API request.

\section{Data collection}
The quantity and the quality of training data is crucial to all computer vision projects. 
However, for this task there was no luxury of using an existing dataset with 
the required level of detail in labels that would also be affordable.

A decision was made to collect own data for this project from a social network that 
makes it easy to associate user profiles with photos of themselves with locations accurate to city-level.
Popular social networks such as Facebook would be ideal for this, however it is not possible to obtain 
a list of profiles from a hand-picked location due to Facebook API constraints. Moreover, it is clearly 
stated in Facebook's Terms and Conditions that any way to circumvent these constraints would still count as a violation.

There was, however, a mobile dating application called Tinder had a documented API that makes it possible to fetch users 
close to user-specified GPS location.
